								My CSSE220 Object Oriented Programming 
								<a href="https://github.com/derrowap/CSSE220-ArcadeGameProject.git" target="_blank">Arcade Game</a> Project
								was the second project I had completed as a Rose-Hulman student. Developed in the winter quarter of my
								freshman year, this was a huge learning experience. The graphics are not very pretty, but as a group,
								we tried to make the best of it. The project idea was created by Rose-Hulman professors, but was inspired
								by a well known game, Dig Dug. <hr>Features include:
								<ul>
									<li>Hero (the user, Shrek), is controlled using the arrow keys</li>
									<li>To progress to the next level, the user must collect all of the onions on the map</li>
									<li>While the user plays through a level, two different monsters will attack</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Nobbin: spawns continuously at a spot in the map (max number of monsters is 2 + the current level).
										This monster cannot dig through the dirt, therefore we wrote an algorithm to find the shortest path
										from its current position to the hero through the already created tunnels. This monster also randomly
										changes into a 'Hobbin' monster and then turns back to normal after a certain amount of time.
										Graphically is Lord Farquaad, from Shrek.</li>
										<li>Hobbin: digs through the dirt, ignoring tunnels, to get to the user in the quickest
										possible route. Graphically is Dragon, from Shrek.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Hero can shoot a ginger bread cookie (using the space button) at monsters to eliminate them</li>
									<li>Money bags (Donkey from shrek) can be dropped if there is an empty space underneath. If the
									bag drops more than one square, it will burst open and turn into Princess Fiona (also from Shrek).
									At this point, Princess Fiona can be saved by the Hero (Shrek) from the evil monsters to gain more
									points. If a money bag ever collides with a monster or the Hero, they will be eliminated.</li>
									<li>The Hero (Shrek) has only 3 lives to get through the game. If at any point the lives run out,
									the user can restart the game and their lives will go back to 3 again.</li>
									<li>Although there were only three levels made, we have a text parser that turns a text document
									into a level. Therefore, new levels can easily be created by creating another text document and
									labeling each block in a map with a key letter described in our code documentation.</li>
									<li>When the user wins the game (collects the last onion on the last level), the user is
									congratulated on their success and have the option to play again.</li>
									<li>In the background, the song All Star by Smash Mouth plays to give more entertainment to the game.</li>
								</ul>

								My CSSE230 Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms 
								<a href="https://github.com/derrowap/FinalProjectCSSE230.git">Navigational Map</a> Project was a school project
								completed during my Sophomore year winter quarter as a student at Rose-Hulman. The project idea was created by my professor
								with a set number of required features. As a group, we decided on implementing several other features to go beyond the
								requirements. It was our job to come up with proper data structures and algorithms in order to implement the
								features in an efficient manner. We applied our knowledge of data structures taught throughout the course to implement
								a graph data structure. We added all the state capitals (minus Hawaii's and Alaska's) as possible destinations.
								<hr>Frontend capabilities (mainly implemented by my group partner) include:
								<ul>
									<li>User can specify a starting, ending, and numerous waypoint destinations to travel to. The user can then decide between
									three searching criteria: shortest time, shortest distance, most interesting route (prioritize destinations
									in route by their rank). Also, if requested, routes with only a specified number of waypoints in total will be displayed as options.
									The user will recieve the three best route options available ordered from best to worst.</li>
									<li>If a route is clicked on, the route is highlighted out on the map for the user to see.</li>
									<li>Routes display the cost of time, distance, and interest (sum of interest ranking from each destination).</li>
									<li>A user can print a selected route to a real life printer using the "User" options in the Menu.</li>
									<li>Details about a destination can be viewed in the right panel by clicking on a route (ending destination is viewed)
									or by hovering over a destination on the map in the middle panel. Details include the name, state, a picture, coordinates,
									and interest rating. There is also a button to open up an embedded Wikipedia page of the state capital.</li>
									<li>Users can list all the different destinations that are above a certain interest rating to view their options or maybe try
									to find a vacation spot. The list of destinations will pop up and can be clicked on to view details in the right panel.</li>
									<li>There are admin options in the menu that allow anyone (with the correct password) to insert or delete new destinations
									within the graph.</li>
									<li>If when typing in a destination, a name does not match, the GUI will display suggestions (retrieved from the backend)
									and can be selected and will automatically be inserted in the text box in the proper format for the user.</li>
								</ul>
								<hr>Backend capabilities (mainly implemented by me) include:
								<ul>
									<li>All the destination objects were created by parsing a text file with the necessary details for each one. After creating
									all the destinations and inserting them into the graph data structure, the graph was saved to an XML file in order to save some
									efficiency on startup.</li>
									<li>The graph was implemented by storing a HashSet (using a LinkedList array and a hash function
									based on the destination's name) of all the destinations and having all of the destinations store the connections themselves.</li>
									<li>A connection is simply an object that stores two destination names and the cost. To reduce space, both destinations store
									a unique LinkedList containing shared connection objects so that there does not have to be double the number of connection objects
									stored.</li>
									<li>To calculate a Route for a user, a min-heap priority queue data structure was chosen to take advantage of A*'s searching
									efficiencies. It starts with a single route object that only contains the starting destination, then builds itself using A*
									until the guaranteed best route is at the top of the min-heap priority queue. When a route is taken off, the data structure will
									automatically rebuild itself to find the next best route available. It takes in considerations of waypoints and different cost
									functions. It is very scalable for any kind of route, additional destinations, and additional cost functions.</li>
									<li>Used in the A* algorithm, the "straight line distance" between two destinations was calculated using the 
									"Great Circle Navigation Formulae." Since the world is not flat, it seemed like a bad estimate for the heursitic function, so I
									found this method online that calculates the actual distance in miles and will even return the exact number Google Maps provides
									when asked the straight line distance.</li>
									<li>The Route class simply extends a LinkedList to efficiently store an ordered list that can quickly add more to the end.</li>

								My CSSE333 Databse Systems <a href="https://github.com/derrowap/StreamTeam" target="_blank">Stream</a> Project is an Android application built
								using Android Studio. My group consisted of Kice Sanders and myself. We used Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Management Studio to build the database used 
								in the application. We were a three person group initially. With this arsenal ready to start, we projected a project that turned out to be too much
								work for a couple reasons. We set out to make an android application that combines the features of Facebook and Twitter into one.
								<hr>Features include:
								<ul>
									<li>Users can create an account with Stream and sign in with Facebook.</li>
									<li>With these accounts, the user can add friends within the Stream app, then message and view their profiles.</li>
									<li>Users can also add someone to their ignore list so that their name does not come up when either one of them search for each other.</li>
									<li>Users are able to message with response time nearly instant. This is because all tables in the database are indexed properly for
									efficieny.</li>
									<li>All of this data is stored in a database, therefore security issues arise, but we made sure they were fixed:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>SQL Injection does not work.</li>
										<li>All communication between the Android application and the database was executed through stored procedures.</li>
										<li>By only allowing stored procedures, it prevents any malicious users from retrieving information about the database.</li>
										<li>Users only have access to data they should be allowed to, such as their friends, possible users to add as friends or
										to put on their ignore list, messages between themselves and other users, and their own profile information.</li>
										<li>Passwords were required to be at least 5 characters long with at least one alphabetical character and one number.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<hr>Database details include:
								<ul>
									<li>All tables have proper primary keys set.</li>
									<li>Referential integrity is maintained through foreign key constraints.</li>
									<li>At least one clustered index or non-Clustered index is on every table based on how the table is used (in order to keep
									maximum efficiency).</li>
									<li>Stored procedures are implemented for every functionality aspect of the database for the Android application to use.</li>
									<li>Views are created to aid in speed of accessing data in stored procedures and to maintain security by not giving access
									to other data from the other tables.</li>
									<li>Triggers are implemented to toggle between which picture the user wants to select to be viewed. A bit is stored with each
									social media page an account is linked to. If this bit is '1', then the picture that goes along with the profile is set to be
									their profile picture, viewable by their friends. If a different picture for that same user is ever set to '1', this trigger
									will fire and ensure all of the other pictures are set to '0' to avoid confusion and false data.</li>
								</ul>
								<hr>Here is the <a href="">open source code</a> provided on GitHub. You can download the application, but will not be able to
								see any data unless on the Rose-Hulman network because that is where the database is hosted unfortunately.
								<br>UNDER CONSTRUCTION: expect a video demonstration in the future to be here.
