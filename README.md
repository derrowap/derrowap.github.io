My personal website where I will show off all my projects and work.

There is a secret page at http://derrow-pinion.com/pages/index2.html that contains a table of contents of many different pages I created to initially learn web development with Bootstrap.

There is also a very buggy and poorly developed rpg-game I worked on for a couple days when I got bored at http://derrow-pinion.com/pages/rpg.com which uses Firebase to allow users to create an account and chat live with anyone else that is on the page. It seems that I am very bad with graphics on an html canvas. Probably should look into libraries if I ever return to this.
