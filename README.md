	<p>My personal website where I will show off all my projects and work.</p>
	<p>As of right now, I am using this strictly to learn how to use Bootstrap for
	web development. By making a bunch of html pages for everything Bootstrap has to
	offer, I will have work to reference back to while I create my website. This is so
	I can look at my own work while I learn instead of continuously looking things up
	online. Plus, it is a great way for me to learn more web development!</p>
