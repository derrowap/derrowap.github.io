<div>
	<p>My personal website where I will show off all my projects and work.</p>
	<p>This is still under construction. Desktop version looks nice. Just finished
	making it look nice on mobile devices as well.</p>
	<p>Known TODO list:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Add to projects: link to github repo, video? demonstration,
			description, maybe jar file in browser but say to use firefox
		</li>
		<li>
			Navigation Bar has "Home" as always active. Use JS to toggle which
			is active based on scrolling.
		</li>
		<li>
			When using a collapsed Navigation Bar that shows a dropdown, when
			clicked on, the drop down stays there, make this go away.
		</li>
		<li>
			Give link to resume on linked in if embedded resume can't open
		</li>
		<li>
			Possibly rephrase About Me descriptions
		</li>
		<li>
			Have this be sourced on my own domain, maybe derrow-pinion.com ?
		</li>
		<li>
			If time allows, add a new page to website that has table of contents to
			problems I have solved on Project Euler, etc, with maybe a description
			or time complexity discussion and state the time it took to execute.
		</li>
	</ul>
